How does JS works?



>> What is a program?
- allocate memory
- parse and execute


>> JS engine consists of two parts:
    - memory heap: memory allocation
    - call stack: read and execute code
        JS is single-threaded, so only 1 call stack

memory leak: when you have un-used memory laying around and eat up memory
deadlock:



>> JS Run-Time Engine

    - In the browser:
        - Web APIs:
            - DOM
            - AJAX (XML httpRequest)
            - Timeout setTimeout()
        - Event loop
        - Callback queue
